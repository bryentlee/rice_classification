# Rice_Classification
Rice, which is among the most widely produced grain products worldwide, has many genetic varieties. These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features such as texture, shape, and color. With these features that distinguish rice varieties, it is possible to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. Dataset contain 5 different rice types images with 15000 images for every category. The goal is to make a classification model that could correctly predict the 5 kinds of rice.
